This implements the client for the Internet of Drinks Server and Machine.

##Configuration

The title of your drink e.g Vodka Orange

####Configuration
The command string to send to the Internet of Drinks Server. It's one or more pump/amount commands e.g 15, which will run pump 1 for the Amount of 5

Example:
1134 for a Vodka Orange (where the Vodka Bottle is on pump 1 and the Orange Juice Bottle on pump 3)

It's also a good idea to drag a colorful image of the configured drink to the dizmo's front side. Then, all you need to do is to click/tap the front side of the dizmo and your drink will be dispensed!
